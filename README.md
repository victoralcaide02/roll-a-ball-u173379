First version of the project, already finished. I have done the entire tutorial and I have also added some features:

- First of all, I have done like a minigame, where the player has to go through a maze to collect the 12 golden cubes.
- I have also put a ramp in the beginning, to check if the gravity works
- Also, I have done a metallic material for the ramp to check if the light works properly (I have put the light above the maze)

I have realised that I did something wrong, I used the newest version of Unity instead of the one that we should use. So I had to start a new project, import all the assets and then import some things (like the Input System again). Anyway, it already works in the correct version of Unity.
